### 6.1A INNER JOIN

(Refer to slides Section VII)

View customer address information with each order by joining tables `CUSTOMER` and `CUSTOMER_ORDER`.

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
ORDER_DATE,
SHIP_DATE,
NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
PRODUCT_ID,
ORDER_QTY

FROM CUSTOMER INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID
```

Joins allow us to keep stored data normalized and simple, but we can get more descriptive views of our data by using joins.

Notice how two customers are omitted since they don't have any orders (refer to slides).


### 6.2B A BAD APPROACH

You may come across a style of joining where commas are used to select the needed tables, and a `WHERE` defines the join condition as shown below:

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
ORDER_DATE,
SHIP_DATE,
NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
PRODUCT_ID,
ORDER_QTY

FROM CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER_ORDER
WHERE CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID
```

Do not use this approach no matter how much your colleagues use it (and educate them not to use it either). It is extremely inefficient as it will generate a cartesian product across both tables (every possible combination of records between both), and then filter it based on the WHERE. It does not work with `LEFT JOIN` either, which we will look at shortly.

Using the `INNER JOIN` with an `ON` condition avoids the cartesian product and is more efficient. Therefore, always use that approach.

### 6.2 LEFT OUTER JOIN

To include all customers, regardless of whether they have orders, you can use a left outer join via `LEFT JOIN` (refer to slides).

If any customers do not have any orders, they will get one record where the `CUSTOMER_ORDER` fields will be null.

```sql
SELECT CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
ORDER_DATE,
SHIP_DATE,
ORDER_ID,
PRODUCT_ID,
ORDER_QTY

FROM CUSTOMER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID
```


## 6.3 Finding Customers with No Orders

With a left outer join, you can filter for NULL values on the `CUSTOMER_ORDER` table to find customers that have no orders.

```sql
SELECT CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME

FROM CUSTOMER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

WHERE ORDER_ID IS NULL
```

You can use a left outer join to find child records with no parent, or parent records with no children (e.g. a `CUSTOMER_ORDER` with no `CUSTOMER`, or a `CUSTOMER` with no `CUSTOMER_ORDER`s).


## 6.4 Joining Multiple Tables

Bring in `PRODUCT` to supply product information for each `CUSTOMER_ORDER`, on top of `CUSTOMER` information.

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
ORDER_DATE,
PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
ORDER_QTY

FROM CUSTOMER INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

INNER JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID
```

## 6.7 Using Expressions with JOINs

You can use expressions combining any fields on any of the joined tables. For instance, we can now get the total revenue for each customer.

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
ORDER_DATE,
PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
ORDER_QTY,
ORDER_QTY * PRICE as REVENUE

FROM CUSTOMER INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

INNER JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID
```


## 6.6 Using GROUP BY with JOINs

You can use `GROUP BY` with a join. For instance, you can find the total revenue for each customer by leveraging all three joined tables, and aggregating the `REVENUE` expression we created earlier.

```sql
SELECT
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
sum(ORDER_QTY * PRICE) as TOTAL_REVENUE

FROM CUSTOMER INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

INNER JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID

GROUP BY 1,2
```

To see all customers even if they had no orders, use a `LEFT JOIN`

```sql
SELECT
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
sum(ORDER_QTY * PRICE) as TOTAL_REVENUE

FROM CUSTOMER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

LEFT JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID

GROUP BY 1,2
```

You can also use a `coalesce()` function to turn null sums into zeros.

```sql
SELECT
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
coalesce(sum(ORDER_QTY * PRICE), 0) as TOTAL_REVENUE

FROM CUSTOMER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

LEFT JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID

GROUP BY 1,2
```
